ABOUT BRANCHES
------------
Created branching system similar to Google's Android.
A -Dev branch and -Stable branch exist.
The first names (not in repository) were Alpha and Beta and the next name will be Daemon.
The theme for naming is MYTHICAL CREATURES (as no one has taken that yet).
Only massive changes including at least one successful stable cycle (or year changes) may post into a branch name change.
Once all systems are stable, simply commit into the -Stable branch to verify stability.
